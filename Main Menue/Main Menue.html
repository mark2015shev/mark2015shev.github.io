<h2>The Chrysalids - Author</h2>
<img src= "The-Chrysalids.jpg" alt="Book cover for 'The Chrysalids'"/>
<p>John Wyndham was born in England in 1903
he became interested in science fiction in the 1920s
his work in sci fi is interesting in that he does not concentrate on amusing the reader with strange inventions of technology from a bewildering future
 Wyndhamâ€™s settings in the future are logical, identifiable extensions of the world of today.
his interest lies in speculation about human nature and human behaviour
this would account for his attention to customs and moral codes displayed in the different societies in his book
time and again he points out the hypocrisy, bigotry and ignorance which are so often a part of our social life and he stresses that changing conditions demand new ways, new customs and new codes of conduct.</p>
