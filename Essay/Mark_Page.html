<h1>The Chrysalids Essay by Mark Shevchenko</h1>

<h1>Chalenge, what was wrong?</h1>

<p>		In the book The Chrysalids, people are destroyed for looking different from the norm. Differences seen in the book include extra toes,
 hairy bodies, long arms and legs. But is this alright? Should the world be ridded of people who are not like the majority of other people?
 The people who are considered normal in this book do not have good reason to destroy the mutants.</p>
 
 <p>	One of the many inadequate reasons for destroying these people is that they believe that having an irregularity is hateful in the sight 
 of God. This thought is flawed because God himself makes us in our mother’s womb as seen in Psalm 139:14; "For you created my inmost being; you 
 knit me together in my mother's womb." Jesus loved all people, even those with disabilities and deformities, and this is shown all through the 
 New Testament of the Bible. The Waknuk community dissects segments from the Bible that they declare necessary and not the whole truth. It is 
true, we are made in God’s image but are we really grasping the full meaning of this verse? Image of God can also include morals, instincts, 
and integrity. God has a reason for everything He does, including what He gives us physically; blonde hair, brown skin or even an extra toe.</p>

<p>		Furthermore, killing another person is very morally wrong. It has never been okay to kill another person nor will it ever be. In this book, 
they kill or banish people with irregularities and what brings them to do this is fear. The innocent babies have no choice in the matter but then
 again, neither do the parents. The parents are filled with so much fear that they do nothing about the situation that their newborn child is in.  
 Even the government is distressed about the thought of another tribulation. The way they deal with their fear is by making the Waknuk people more 
 fearful than they are themselves. This fear might be rational but it is not enough to justify killing innocent children. One would hope that at 
 least a few people in the story would feel this way. David's Aunt Harriet has this outlook but is denied the freedom to express her opinions and 
 ends up killing herself.</p>
 
 <p>	In addition, the characters are so attached to their own thoughts and beliefs that they are not open to other opinions and to realising the 
 flaws of their own theories. It just is not practical to be like this because it prevents learning anything new or gaining any knowledge about the
 world. People are all equal, no one person being better than another. This balance is upset when one person kills another because they are, in a 
 way, stating that they think they are better than someone else. Things like this happen because people are uninformed or they believe only what they
 want to believe. It is important to take time to find information about a situation to ensure the right decision is being made. If the Waknuk people 
 took the time to read and understand God’s words they would not be able to find a reason to kill the deviants. In fact, they would do whatever they 
 could to help the deviants.</p>
 
 <p>	In conclusion, it is imperative to understand the error of your mistakes before it is too late. In this book, the mistakes are not noticed and it
 drives the unjustified people to run for safety. The normal people in this book have many reasons to believe that they need to get rid of mutants but 
 all of their reasons are inconsistent.</p>
